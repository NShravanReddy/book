Hi there. My name is shravan. I had completed my under-graduation in May 2023 under the specialisation of computer science and technology. I have been looking for the jobs from then. From  August to September  2023 selected for CNCF zero to merge cohort from there I had gained insights of contributing to open source community. I have been looking for Gnome os organisations thank god that I found it through Outreachy's support.


I had experience with CNCF projects for a month as I had been selected for the program CNCF zero to merge cohort. From there I had gained how the start contributing to the open source community. Then I applied for the Outreachy internship.


Hi there. My name is shravan. I had completed my under-graduation in May 2023 under the specialisation of computer science and technology. I have been looking for the jobs from then. From  August to September  2023 selected for CNCF zero to merge cohort from there I had gained insights of contributing to open source community.  I am very much interested in this project because I had seen many projects on Outreachy website  but I got attracted to this testing of Gnome os. From the day I saw this project I still remember my excitement to the project to set up locally. The way the community is helping to solve my error made me comfortable to apply to this community.  It had taken a very long time from October 4  to end of month for  running  tests locally. I enjoyed the way to debug errors through logs. My main goal of doing internship is  to learn how to test Gnome os on mobile size screen and also if possible on tablet screen too.  Then I wanted to develop end to tests that you had mentioned in the internship tasks for the apps like Software to search the apps and turn on auto updates,  in System monitor app opening file System option , also in Settings app to test 8 visual accessibility features like High contrast, Large text, Screen records, etc.  And in Weather app to search specific location like UK  and if they are finished and if the internship has time then will work on other apps too.The timeline that I am submitting is Tests for Gnome os on mobile screen  size is 1 month 25 days, for 25 core apps and then  normal screen apps end to end  testing 35days ,25 days to Gnome shell accessibility features and remaining 25 days for adding a version of gnome_welcome and gnome_apps tests in Turkish and if possible in Japanese too. If any tasks are completed before the deadline will be working on the Tests for  Gnome os Tablet screen size  and also will be taking feedback from you and community to improve the Gnome os openqa project . I am willing to contribute to Gnome os for the long term too. I am also interested in making support of Gnome os tests to ARM based devices too. That's it about the time line of the internship and will be improving my self based on the feedback provided during the weekly meetings.Dear Hiring manager,
			      My name is N Shravan Reddy. I am passionate machine learning engineer and a techie. I had achieved  4 stars for python in hacker rank, now looking to enhance my coding skills, and gain exposure to new tools and programming languages. As you can see by my resume, I Developed user Interfaces with modern JavaScript from HTML5, and CSS3,in which a non tech user can use the website easily which improved user satisfaction. Also, Created accessible, responsive, and functional user Interfaces to allow visitors on any device to have the  same perfect user experience. I also worked on deep learning network called  convolutional neural network in which I trained the machine learning model using the data sets using the NumPy, pandas modules and TensorFlow as package and achieved the accuracy rate of 96% accuracy. 
I am writing this letter regarding my interest to work with your organization.Another project is Developed a machine learning model utilising Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms in Python to accurately predict weekly sales,aiding in demand forecasting and optimising inventory management.Preprocessed and analysed sales data, trained the model using Random Forest and XGBoost, achieving precise weekly sales predictions and facilitating data-driven decision-making.Tools used are Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook. Currently working on Google cloud platform with the tools like Big Query, AutoML.I would be happy to provide any other additional information that you may require in this regard.

Thanking you and looking forward to your favorable response
